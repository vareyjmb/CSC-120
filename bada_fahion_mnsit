1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images of clothing items such as shirts, shoes, bags, and trousers.
It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each with a size of 28×28 pixels.
It is commonly used to train and test machine learning and neural network models for image classification.

2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?

We normalize image pixel values to scale them to a smaller range, usually between 0 and 1.
This helps the neural network learn faster and more accurately.
Normalization also prevents large pixel values from dominating the learning process and improves model stability.

3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.

Flatten Layer – Converts the 2D image (28×28) into a 1D array of pixels.

Dense (Hidden) Layer – Learns patterns and features from the input data using neurons and activation functions.

Dense (Output) Layer – Produces the final predictions, one for each clothing category.

4. What does an epoch mean in model training?

An epoch is one complete pass of the entire training dataset through the neural network.
During each epoch, the model updates its weights to improve accuracy.
Multiple epochs are used to help the model learn better from the data.

5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.
The predicted label is the class chosen by the model for the first test image.
The actual label is the true class provided in the dataset.
If both labels match, the prediction is correct; if not, it is a misclassification.

6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?

Add more hidden layers or neurons to increase model capacity.

Train for more epochs or adjust the learning rate.

Use regularization techniques like dropout.

Apply data augmentation or use a convolutional neural network (CNN).
